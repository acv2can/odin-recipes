        <p class="text">The Pastafrola is an argentinian pie that consists of a regular pie crust filled with quince jelly and topped with grated coconut.</p>
        <p class="text">Today I´ll show you how it´s done so you can make one at home and share it with your loved ones, but keep in mind that this pastry is <strong>highly</strong> addictive, so if you're on a diet, you should be careful. </p>
        <h3 class="ingredients"><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>200gr of butter</li>
            <li>100gr of sugar</li>
            <li>Half a tablespoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>500gr of self-rising flour</li>
            <li>500gr of quince jelly</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of cognac</li>
            <li>150ml of warm water</li>
            <li>10gr of grated coconut</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="steps"><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Mix the butter, which has to be at room temperature, with the sugar.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one by one to the previous mix along with the vanilla extract and whisk until everything is amalgamated.</li>
            <li>Add the flour to the mix and try to <em>fraisage</em> everything together, so the dough is perfectly formed. Do <strong>NOT</strong> knead it, or you will ruin it.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is made, wrap it in film paper and take it to the fridge for an hour.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, add the warm water and the cognac to the quince jelly and smash it, so it ends up being a mush.</li>
            <li>After the dough has rested in the fridge, take it out and stretch it so you can cover a pie mold with it. Leave out about 1/4 of the dough for the decorations. </li>
            <li>Fill the pie with the quince mush then stretch the leftover dough, cut it in stripes and put it on top of the filled pie creating a lattice. </li>
            <li>Finally, put the Pastafrola in the oven at 180 Celsius degrees for 40 minutes. After you take it out, sprinkle some grated coconut on top. </li>
